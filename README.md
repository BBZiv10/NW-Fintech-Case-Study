## BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

### What specific financial problem is the company solving:   
XRP is a token used for representing the transfer of value across the Ripple Network. The main purpose of XRP is to be a mediator for other - both cryptocurrencies and fiat – exchanges in order to seamlessly transfer value from one to another instantly and across borders. 

### Companies intended customers:  
The Ripple cryptocurrency, XRP, may be purchased by anyone however, while you can buy XRP, it’s not intended for consumer use. Instead, it’s a token that provides liquidity for banks as they facilitate cross-border transfers.

### Market size: 	
Unlike most blockchain technology that’s secured by a decentralized network of miners, Ripple is secured by a network of validating servers with an internal ledger that guarantee transactions based on consensus. Instead of mining rewards, all 100 billion Ripple coins are pre-mined, and Ripple Labs controls the dispersion of new coins. So far, there are 38.7 billion XRP in circulation, and Ripple Labs will release more as needed to control money supply.

### Which Technologies is Ripple currently using:   
The Ripple Net is an open source project, and it’s cryptography is different from other crypto projects. Unlike other blockchain projects, Ripple relies on institutions to operate its network. While anyone can run a node of the Ripple network, these trusted gateways (like banks and other institutions) are the ones who facilitate transactions on Ripple, providing currency exchange, fiat deposits, and other means of transfer. 
XCurrent is the first step, instead of nostro/vostro accounts, xCurrent is enterprise software that allows banks to instantly settle transactions. The technology allows banks to review information about transactions and resolve any compliance issues before authorizing the transaction. This allows for high straight through processing rates and lowered overhead on fixing or reversing bad transactions.  The payoff for financial institutions is reduced costs and increased processing rates. If you make cross-border transactions instantaneous and cheap, more customers will choose to use it and the overall market for cross-border transaction grows with each cost and time reduction. Many people wonder what makes Ripple different from a company like PayPal or Stripe in terms of payment processing. While PayPal and Stripe are direct to consumer solutions, Ripple operates more as infrastructure for banks than as a standalone solution. Additionally, the RippleNet doesn’t rely on Ripple the company to continue to function. If PayPal were to shut down, so would their payments. If Ripple shuts down, the Ripple Net will continue to exist. Finally, PayPal still relies on older technologies like ACH to process its transactions. Ripple is a payment processing technology itself that directly integrates with banks and other partner gateway institutions, with faster processing times and lower fees than PayPal.
Ripple also hopes to become an industry standard. Their system of verifying servers is meant to act as a third-party authority that sets standards for cross-border transactions. Some banks could try to implement a similar technology to Ripple, but ultimately that technology would be limited to the banks that created it and would be less useful compared to an open-source, international standard that any bank could join.


## LANDSCAPE

### Core Metrics: 
Market capitalization amount is the main metric being used today to determine the strength of any particular crypto-currency and to measure its success. However, this may not be the best way to show the strength of a blockchain crypto. Perhaps, a more important metric may be use-case and number of users current.
